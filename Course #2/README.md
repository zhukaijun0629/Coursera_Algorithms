# Course #2 - Graph Search, Shortest Paths, and Data Structures
Coursera Algorithms specialization offered by **Stanford University**

[**Coursera Certificate**](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/ZADJZ6GNFB9D)

## Course overview
Algorithms are the heart of computer science, and the subject has countless practical applications as well as intellectual depth. This specialization is an introduction to algorithms for learners with at least a little programming experience. The specialization is rigorous but emphasizes the big picture and conceptual understanding over low-level implementation and mathematical details. After completing this specialization, you will have a greater mastery of algorithms than almost anyone without a graduate degree in the subject. Specific topics in Part 2 of the specialization include: data structures (heaps, balanced search trees, hash tables, bloom filters), graph primitives (applications of breadth-first and depth-first search, connectivity, shortest paths), and their applications (ranging from deduplication to social network analysis).
